Everyone from exciting start-ups including Spotify, Lyst and Made.com to global brands such as Google, Apple and Net-a-porter, plus 1000's more have used Appear Here to launch pop-up stores. In the last 12 months, Appear Here launched over 3000 stores in London alone.

Appear Here is building a global network of the best retail spaces and working exclusively with some of the biggest landlords in the world including Land Securities, Hammerson and Westfield.

From effortless order tracking, proactive communications, and seamless returns, Narvar applies machine learning across billions of interactions to simplify the everyday lives of consumers.

Our story

Narvar was founded by retail, customer experience, and logistics experts from leading global brands like Apple, Walmart and LVMH. Retailers have traditionally been focused on acquiring customers and driving them to make a purchase, after which the romance is gone. But it's the experience beyond the ""buy"" button that is ripe for building customer loyalty. Our founder, Amit Sharma, identified this significant gap in the typical customer journey--the new moment of truth--and created the post-purchase category to help retailers turn shoppers into lifelong advocates. 


We're hiring!

We've assembled a team of experts from different backgrounds who share a passion for building great customer experiences. Our folks are collaborative self-starters and best-in-class in their respective fields.
