With fresh water scarcity affecting up to 2 billion people around the world, Orbital Systems is an idea whose time has come.

Our story

Narvar was founded by retail, customer experience, and logistics experts from leading global brands like Apple, Walmart and LVMH. Retailers have traditionally been focused on acquiring customers and driving them to make a purchase, after which the romance is gone. But it's the experience beyond the ""buy"" button that is ripe for building customer loyalty. Our founder, Amit Sharma, identified this significant gap in the typical customer journey--the new moment of truth--and created the post-purchase category to help retailers turn shoppers into lifelong advocates.
