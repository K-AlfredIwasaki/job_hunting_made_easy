Compare that to the technology in your life. You know, those rectangular boxes that you spend the majority of your life staring into? The ones that demand your attention, and keep you distracted from the things that really matter: Friends! Family! Dragons!

With those things in mind, we decided to take a different path and rethink the relationship technology has with people.

The company acquires quality borrowers through multiple channels, and has been able to establish a leadership position in China’s consumer lending industry because the company is able to use its proprietary technology to efficiently identify and select prime and near-prime EMMAs for its platform. Through its “low and grow” strategy, the company initially offers smaller, shorter-term loans to these EMMAs and then uses its proprietary decisioning technology to proactively offer them larger, longer-term loans as they demonstrate positive credit behavior, allowing the company to retain high quality EMMAs with significant lifetime consumer value.",2001,"{'陆金所': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/lufax', 'Kabbage, Inc': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/kabbage-inc', 'Patch of Land': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/patch-of-land', 'Avant': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/avantcredit', 'auxmoney': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/auxmoney-gmbh', 'Prosper Marketplace': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/prosper-marketplace'}"

The orderbird AG was founded in March 2011 with the aim of adapting traditional billing software to the needs of the modern restaurant business. All the relevant POS processes has been integrated into the orderbird software, which has made it both easy and attractive to use on Apple’s handheld devices.

It was through Bastian Schmidtke's previous work with classic POS systems and a preference for Apple products, that he got inspired to create a modern POS solution for the iPad - thus the idea for what would later become orderbird was a reality.

Then in 2010 during the reopening of the famous P1 Club in Munich the club requested the three founders to come up with a modern POS solution. Bastian Schmidtke, Jakob Schreyer, Artur Hasselbach and Patrick Brienen then decided to form the orderbird platform - an extensive and open POS-system for the restaurant business - based on the original idea of Bastian.

Everyone told us the easy money was in running ads for traditional brokers, but we couldn’t stop thinking about how different real estate would be if it were designed from the ground up, using technology and totally different values, to put customers first. 

So we joined forces with agents who wanted to be customer advocates, not salesmen. 

Since these were our own agents, we could survey each customer on our service and pay a bonus based on the review. 

We deepened our technology beyond the initial search to make the home tour, the listing debut, the escrow process, the whole process, faster, easier and worry-free. 

And we gave customers more value, not just by saving each thousands in fees, but by investing in every home we sell, by measuring our performance and improving constantly.

Nanosys is changing the way we see things. Our quantum dot technology creates a visual experience that is truer to reality by enabling LCDs to display over 50% more color than they can today.

As an enterprise-grade SaaS platform serving 350+ retailers like Sephora, Neiman-Marcus, Crate & Barrel, and Gamestop, Narvar drives brand loyalty at scale by enabling immersive and emotional post-purchase customer experiences. From effortless order tracking, proactive communications, and seamless returns, Narvar applies machine learning across billions of interactions to simplify the everyday lives of consumers.

Our story

Narvar was founded by retail, customer experience, and logistics experts from leading global brands like Apple, Walmart and LVMH. Retailers have traditionally been focused on acquiring customers and driving them to make a purchase, after which the romance is gone. But it's the experience beyond the ""buy"" button that is ripe for building customer loyalty. Our founder, Amit Sharma, identified this significant gap in the typical customer journey--the new moment of truth--and created the post-purchase category to help retailers turn shoppers into lifelong advocates.
