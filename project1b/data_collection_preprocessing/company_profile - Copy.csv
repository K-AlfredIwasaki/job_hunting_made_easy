Compare that to the technology in your life. You know, those rectangular boxes that you spend the majority of your life staring into? The ones that demand your attention, and keep you distracted from the things that really matter: Friends! Family! Dragons!

With those things in mind, we decided to take a different path and rethink the relationship technology has with people.

The company acquires quality borrowers through multiple channels, and has been able to establish a leadership position in China’s consumer lending industry because the company is able to use its proprietary technology to efficiently identify and select prime and near-prime EMMAs for its platform. Through its “low and grow” strategy, the company initially offers smaller, shorter-term loans to these EMMAs and then uses its proprietary decisioning technology to proactively offer them larger, longer-term loans as they demonstrate positive credit behavior, allowing the company to retain high quality EMMAs with significant lifetime consumer value.",2001,"{'陆金所': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/lufax', 'Kabbage, Inc': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/kabbage-inc', 'Patch of Land': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/patch-of-land', 'Avant': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/avantcredit', 'auxmoney': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/auxmoney-gmbh', 'Prosper Marketplace': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/prosper-marketplace'}"
